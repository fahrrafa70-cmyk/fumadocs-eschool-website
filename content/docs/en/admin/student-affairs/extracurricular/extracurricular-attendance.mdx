Recording attendance is the primary responsibility of an Admin or Coach at every meeting. The **Attendance** page in eSchool is designed so the data entry process becomes very fast. The data you enter here will be automatically calculated into monthly attendance percentages.

## Requirements Before Inputting Attendance

Before you can fill out the attendance sheet, ensure these two things have been met:
1. **Member Registration:** Students must have **Approved** status. Students who are still pending will not appear on the attendance sheet.
2. **Schedule (Timetable):** That extracurricular must already have a meeting schedule in the system.

## Steps for Filling Attendance

Follow this procedure at every extracurricular meeting:

### 1. Selecting Meeting Session
- Navigate to **Student Affairs** → **Extracurricular** → **Input Attendance**.
- **Select Extracurricular:** Use the dropdown to select the activity.
  - *Note:* Coaches will only see the extracurriculars they lead.
- **Select Date:** Click on the calendar picker to determine the practice date. By default, the system will point to today's date.

### 2. Loading Student List
- Click the **Show Students** or **Load Attendance** button.
- The system will display a table of all students who are official members.

### 3. Providing Attendance Status
In the **Action** column, you can select student attendance status using radio buttons. 4 status options are available:

| Option | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Present** | Student attended the activity according to schedule. |
| **Sick** | Student was unable to attend due to health reasons. |
| **Permission** | Student was unable to attend with official permission (Leave). |
| **Absent** | Student did not attend without explanation (Alpha). |

#### Quick Action Feature
To speed up the process, you can use the **Quick Action** buttons above the table. This feature will mark **all students** in the list with the selected status automatically:

- 🟢 **Present:** Marks all students as Present.
- 🟡 **Sick:** Marks all students as Sick.
- 🔵 **Leave:** Marks all students as Permission (Leave).
- 🔴 **Absent:** Marks all students as Absent (Alpha).

### 4. Saving Data
- Once all students are marked, scroll to the bottom of the page.
- Click the **Save** button (red floppy disk icon).
- Wait for a success notification from the system.

## Changing Incorrect Attendance

What if you misclicked or just remembered a student had permission after data was saved?

1. Ensure you are on the **Input Attendance** page.
2. Re-select the same **Extracurricular** and **Date** as the data you want to change.
3. Click **Load**. The system will display previously saved data.
4. Change the attendance status of the intended student.
5. Click the **Update Attendance** button.

## Data Validation & Security

- **Schedule Check:** The system will provide a Warning if you try to input attendance on a date that does not match the routine schedule. Even if there is a warning, you can still save it (useful for additional/incidental practices).
- **Change Log:** Every attendance update will be recorded by the system regarding who changed it and when it was done.
- **Cloud Storage:** Data is directly saved to the central server, making it safe from the risks of manual data loss like on paper attendance books.

## Tips & Best Practices

- ⚡ **Real-time Input:** Fill out attendance directly as the activity takes place or at most on the same day. Delaying input risks incorrect memory.
- 📸 **Supporting Documentation:** Always take activity photos as physical evidence if a dispute regarding student attendance ever occurs.
- 🗣️ **Communication:** If there are students who are frequently absent (more than 3 consecutive times), immediately use the recap feature to report them to the Class Teacher.

## FAQ

**Q: Why is student A's name not on the attendance list?**
- ✅ Check student A's registration status in the **Member List** menu. They might still be `Pending` or not approved yet.

**Q: Can I input attendance for last month?**
- ✅ Yes, as long as that date range is within the active school year. However, it is highly recommended to be disciplined in filling it out daily.

**Q: Can parents see if their child is not present?**
- ✅ Yes, parents will receive notifications or can view extracurricular attendance history through their respective mobile applications.
