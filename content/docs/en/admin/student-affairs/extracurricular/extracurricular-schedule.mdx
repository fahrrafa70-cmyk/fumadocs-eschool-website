Good schedule management is the key to student discipline. The **Extracurricular Schedule** page allows Admins and Coaches to set exactly when activities take place each week. This schedule information will be immediately visible on each student's mobile app calendar or dashboard.

## Why Should the Schedule be Filled?
- 🎯 **Attendance Target:** You cannot input attendance if the meeting schedule hasn't been determined.
- 📱 **Mobile Notification:** Students will get automatic reminders on their phones based on this schedule.
- 🤝 **Room Coordination:** Avoid conflicts in the use of facilities (such as fields or halls) between activities.

## Creating a Meeting Schedule

Each extracurricular can have one or more meeting schedules per week.

### Schedule Input Steps:

1. **Access Schedule Page**
   - Go to **Student Affairs** → **Extracurricular** → **Schedule (Timetable)**.

2. **Select Extracurricular**
   - Search and select the extracurricular name from the dropdown (e.g., "Basketball").

3. **Determine Day & Time**
   - **Day:** Select the meeting day (Monday - Sunday).
   - **Start Time:** Enter activity start time (24-hour format, e.g., `15:30`).
   - **End Time:** Enter activity end time (e.g., `17:00`).

4. **Save Schedule**
   - Click **Store Schedule**.
   - Data will be saved in the `eskul_timetables` table.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The system has time validation: **End Time must be greater than Start Time**. If you enter inverted times, the system will issue an error message.

## Managing Existing Schedules

Once a schedule is created, you can monitor all weekly agendas through the available table.

### Viewing Schedule Table
The table will display summaries like this:

| Extracurricular | Day | Time | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Basketball | Tuesday | 15:30 - 17:00 | ✏️ 🗑️ |
| Basketball | Friday | 14:00 - 15:30 | ✏️ 🗑️ |
| Scouts | Saturday | 08:00 - 10:00 | ✏️ 🗑️ |

### Changing (Edit) Schedule
If there is a change in school policy or a shift in hours:
1. Click the **Edit** icon on the intended schedule.
2. Update the day or time in the modal that appears.
3. Click **Save Changes**.

### Deleting Schedule
There are two ways to delete:
- **Individual Delete:** Click the red trash icon on a specific row to delete only one session.
- **Reset All (Nuclear Option):** Use the **Reset All Schedules** button if you want to clear all schedules for a specific extracurricular (e.g., at the turn of a semester).

> [!WARNING]
> Deleting or resetting the schedule **will not** delete attendance data already recorded in the past, but it will stop notifications to students and prevent new attendance input for those days.

## Best Practices in Scheduling

1. **Consistency:** Try to keep the schedule the same throughout the semester to make it easier for students to manage their study time.
2. **Ideal Duration:** On average, extracurricular activities are effective for 90-120 minutes.
3. **Coordination:** Check other extracurricular schedules so students active in more than one activity do not experience time conflicts.
4. **Regular Updates:** Immediately update the schedule in the eSchool system if there are sudden changes so students don't come to school when activities are canceled.

## Tips & Troubleshooting

- **Schedule Not Appearing in App?**
  Ensure you have pressed the save button and received a success notification. Try refreshing the student mobile app.
  
- **Schedule Conflicts:**
  The system currently allows inputting the same hours between different extracurriculars (since training locations might be different). Ensure coaches have coordinated manually.

- **Incidental Meetings:**
  If there are additional practice sessions outside the routine schedule (e.g., ahead of a competition), you should still input them as a new schedule so that attendance for those extra sessions can be recorded by the system.
