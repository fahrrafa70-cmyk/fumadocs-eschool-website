The **Offline Exams** page is the central hub for managing face-to-face exams. While major exam agendas are typically managed by the **Curriculum Admin**, the system also empowers **Teachers** to independently create exam agendas and schedules for their assigned subjects, while remaining under central supervision and coordination.
