The **Member List** page is the control center for you as a Coach to determine which students are eligible to join the activities you lead. As a coach, you have full responsibility to review, approve, or reject student registrations that come through the mobile application.

> [!NOTE]
> As a Coach, you are only responsible for members in the extracurricular activities you lead. You cannot see or process registrations for other activities led by other fellow teachers.

## Registration & Approval Workflow

The new member recruitment process in eSchool follows an efficient digital workflow:

1. **Registration:** Students select your extracurricular on their mobile app and click the "Register" button.
2. **Review:** Student data enters the Coach dashboard system with a **Pending** status.
3. **Decision:** You review the student's identity and decide to **Approve** or **Reject**.
4. **Notification:** Students receive automatic notifications on their phones regarding the registration status.

### Understanding Member Status

Identify the status labels that appear on your member table:

- 🟡 **Pending:** The student has just registered and is waiting for your approval.
- 🟢 **Approved:** The student is officially a member. Only students with this status will appear in the meeting attendance list.
- 🔴 **Rejected:** The student is rejected from joining (possibly because the quota is full or they do not meet the criteria).

## Managing Members

The Member page is equipped with search and filter features to make it easier for you to manage many students at once.

### 1. Filtering & Searching Members
You can narrow down the list that appears using:
- **Select Extracurricular:** (If you lead more than one activity).
- **Grade Level:** Filter students by class level (e.g., only grade 10).
- **Status:** Filter based on Pending, Approved, or Rejected.
- **Search Column:** Search for specific students using their full name or NISN.

### 2. Approving Registrants

**A. Individual Method (One by one):**
- Find the student name row with a Pending status.
- Click the **Check (✓)** button in the action column.
- Click "Yes" in the confirmation window that appears.

**B. Bulk Method (Bulk Approve):**
Use this feature if there are many registrants at once at the beginning of the semester:
- Check the box to the left of the student names you want to approve.
- Click the blue **Approve Selected Members** button that appears above the table.
- All students you selected will be approved in one click. ⚡

### 3. Rejecting Registrants
If the registration is not suitable or the quota has been met:
- Click the red **Cross (✗)** button on the relevant student row.
- Once rejected, that student will not be able to participate in activity attendance.

## Viewing Student Details

Before giving approval, you can view the student's full profile by clicking on the student's name row. A window (*modal*) will appear displaying:
- Student's profile photo.
- NISN and Class.
- The date the student submitted the registration.
- Quick action buttons (Approve/Reject) at the bottom of the detail window.

## Exporting Member Data

If you need a list of member names in physical form or an Excel file for report purposes to the curriculum or student affairs side:
1. Click the **Export** button.
2. Select the desired file format (e.g., **Excel**).
3. The file will be automatically downloaded with the name format: `rekap-anggota-[eskul-name]-[date].xlsx`.

## Best Practices for Coaches

- ✅ **Routine Checks:** Perform new registration checks at least every 2 days so students do not wait too long without certainty.
- ✅ **Quota Communication:** If your activity quota is limited, immediately change the status to `Rejected` for registrants who do not fit the criteria so they can immediately register in other activities that are still available.
- ✅ **Class Validation:** Ensure the students who register really come from the class level allowed to participate in the activity.
- ✅ **Appreciation:** Use this list to monitor student progress regularly and give appreciation to those who joined early with enthusiasm.

## Troubleshooting

- **Student Claims to Have Registered but Does Not Appear?**
  Ensure you are not activating the wrong filter (e.g., a different class filter). Ask students to ensure their registration was successful on the mobile app side.
  
- **Approve Button Cannot be Clicked?**
  Ensure your internet connection is stable. If it still cannot, contact the School Admin to ensure the access rights (*permission*) of your coach account have been configured correctly.
